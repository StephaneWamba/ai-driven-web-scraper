# Implementation Plan: AI-Driven E-Commerce Intelligence Scraper

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a portfolio project demonstrating advanced web scraping with AI-powered data extraction for competitive price intelligence.

**Target**: Business clients seeking competitive intelligence solutions
**Tech Stack**: React + FastAPI + Terraform + AWS + Playwright + OpenAI

---

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)

**Deliverable**: Complete AWS infrastructure with Terraform

### 1.1 Terraform Configuration

- [ ] RDS PostgreSQL instance (for data storage)
- [ ] EC2 instance for FastAPI backend (t3.micro)
- [ ] Security groups (minimal access)
- [ ] S3 bucket (for backup/export data)

### 1.2 Infrastructure Components

```
terraform/
├── main.tf              # Main resources (EC2, RDS, S3)
├── variables.tf         # Input variables
├── outputs.tf          # Output values
└── providers.tf        # AWS provider config
```

## Phase 3: FastAPI Backend (Week 2)

**Deliverable**: RESTful API with database integration

### 3.1 API Endpoints

```
POST /api/scrape/start      # Start scraping job
GET  /api/scrape/status     # Job status
GET  /api/products          # Get scraped products
GET  /api/analysis          # Competitive analysis
POST /api/alerts            # Price drop alerts
```

### 3.2 Database Schema

```sql
-- Products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    competitor VARCHAR(50),
    url TEXT,
    scraped_at TIMESTAMP,
    confidence_score FLOAT
);

-- Scraping jobs table
CREATE TABLE scraping_jobs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    target_urls TEXT[],
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 3.3 Core Features

- [ ] Async job processing
- [ ] Database CRUD operations
- [ ] Data validation with Pydantic
